      <p contenteditable="true">I just recently took a trip to peru which is what gave me the inspiration for all of this. When I was in peru wed constantly have limes in our hotel in a bowl by the bar, so I decided to send my limey charachter to peru. I wanted to firstly use photoshop to make a cute imovie style intro as if two old people made it to post on facebook. 
        I used AI due to the lack of copyright free images of limes for the background and noticed it had a nice gradient. 
        I then added that to my text and put it in the most fitting position. For music I used drums and flutes from Peru due to its easy fair use and its matching sounds, I also think its what an old copuple would listen to.
        For the drawings I used a mix of illustator and photoshop, I used photoshop to make my freely editable Lime hand that I was able to add anywhere for the camera holding effect. I also drew him in all around Peru having a peachy trip with his wife. For the Audio I recorded it on my phone like we learned in class then reduced the noise in Audacity for a cleaner sound.
        I hope this video brings you the same endearing yet nostalgic feelig it gives me.
